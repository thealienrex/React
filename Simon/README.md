# Simon

Welcome to my mini project built with React, **Simon**.

This web app simulates the old Simon game, where the machine gives you a sequence of colors and you have to repeat it back. 

The project is mid-stream, as I need to address some issues with state.


The app is currently only available in development mode. To start the app, you can run: 

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
