# D&D Nite

Welcome to my mini project built with React, **D&D Nite**.

This web app lets you build a list of available D&D players, with selection criteria of available days, timezone, and player/GM preference. The list of available players dynamically changes as you choose criteria, culminating in a potential group of players/GMs.

The app is still in development. All functionality lives in the one app.js file, and needs to be broken out into separate function files. Also, as this a mini personal project, I haven't marked up the code with comments around what each function does. The names should be self-explanatory, or at least indicative of the purpose.

The app is currently only available in development mode. To start the app, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
